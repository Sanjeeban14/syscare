# Syscare — Linux System Maintenance Tool

**Syscare** is a modular Bash-based system maintenance agent for Ubuntu Linux, providing:

* System **health checks** (CPU, memory, disk)
* **Cleanup** of old logs and reports
* Automated **backups** with retention
* **JSON reports** for programmatic monitoring
* Optional **systemd integration** for automatic execution

---

## Features

* Modular architecture: `health`, `cleanup`, `backup`
* **Configurable thresholds** via `/etc/syscare/syscare.conf`
* JSON output for integration with dashboards or backend systems
* Supports **development mode** (repo) and **installed mode**
* Systemd service and timer for daily automation
* Optional **Node.js backend** to collect JSON reports centrally

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanjeeban14/syscare.git
cd syscare
```

Run the install script:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

This will:

* Create system directories:

```text
/usr/local/lib/syscare       # code
/etc/syscare                 # config
/var/log/syscare             # logs
/var/lib/syscare             # runtime data / backups
/usr/local/bin/syscare       # global CLI wrapper
```

* Copy code (`lib/`, `syscare.sh`) to `/usr/local/lib/syscare`
* Copy config to `/etc/syscare/syscare.conf`
* Install a global wrapper `/usr/local/bin/syscare` for easy execution

## Quick Start

For a new user, you can install and enable syscare in one go:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sanjeeban14/syscare.git
cd syscare

# Install syscare system-wide
sudo ./install.sh

# Enable and start daily systemd timer
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now syscare.timer

# Verify the timer is active
systemctl list-timers | grep syscare

# Run manually if desired
syscare all | jq .
```
---

## Usage

```bash
syscare check             # Run health checks
syscare cleanup           # Run cleanup (dry-run by default)
syscare cleanup --apply   # Apply cleanup (delete files)
syscare backup            # Run backup with retention
syscare all               # Run all modules and emit JSON report
```

Example JSON output:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-31T00:45:00+05:30",
  "health": {
    "cpu": {"status": "ok", "load_1m": "0.5", "threshold": "1.0"},
    "memory": {"status": "ok", "usage_percent": 45, "threshold": 80},
    "disk": {"status": "ok", "threshold": 85}
  },
  "cleanup": {
    "status": "ok",
    "deleted_files": 0,
    "dry_run": true,
    "days": 7
  },
  "backup": {
    "status": "ok",
    "archive": "backup-2025-12-30T20:29:10+05:30.tar.gz",
    "retention_count": 5
  }
}
```

> Tip: Pipe JSON output to `jq` for readability:

```bash
syscare all | jq .
```

---

## Configuration

Default configuration file: `/etc/syscare/syscare.conf`

```ini
# CPU, memory, disk thresholds
CPU_THRESHOLD=1.0
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=80
DISK_THRESHOLD=85

# Cleanup
CLEANUP_DAYS=7

# Backup retention
RETENTION_COUNT=5
```

* Can override thresholds via CLI options:

```bash
syscare all --cpu-threshold=0.8 --memory-threshold=75
```

When retry queue is enabled, failed reports are stored locally and retried later.
No manual intervention is required.

---

## Systemd Integration

Optional: run syscare automatically using systemd timer.

1. Copy systemd units:

```bash
sudo cp systemd/syscare.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/syscare.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable syscare.timer
sudo systemctl start syscare.timer
```

2. Check timer:

```bash
systemctl list-timers | grep syscare
```

* JSON reports are logged to `journald` or `/var/log/syscare/syscare.log`
View logs (journald)
```bash
journalctl -u syscare.service
```
Follow logs live:
```bash
journalctl -u syscare.service -f
```

> **Tip:** For testing, you can set `OnUnitActiveSec=20s` in the timer and reset to `1d` for daily execution later.

Do this after every change:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart syscare.timer

```
---
## Backend Integration (Optional)

Syscare can send its JSON reports to a central backend server.

The backend is a **Node.js + Express REST API** that accepts reports via HTTP.

### Backend Features

* REST API (`/api/health`)
* Health endpoint (`/api/health`)
* Stores JSON reports on disk
* Designed to run as a **systemd service**

### Backend Installation

From the syscare repo root:

```bash
chmod +x install-backend.sh
./install-backend.sh
```
This wil:
 - Verify Node.js(>=18)
 - Optionally install/upgrade Node.js with user content
 - Install backend dependencies
 - Install and register ```syscare-backend.service```
Enable backend:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now syscare-backend.service
```
Verify backend health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
Expected output:
```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### Sending Reports from Syscare
When backend reporting is enabled, syscare sends its final JSON report automatically at the end of execution.

No changes to core syscare commands are required.
```yaml
# Backend reporting
BACKEND_ENABLED=true
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/reports
BACKEND_HEALTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Retry Queue (Failure-Safe Reporting)
Backend reporting in syscare is **best-effort and non-blocking**

If the backend is unavialable (network down, service stopped, etc):
 - JSON reports are **queued locally** in pending directory.
  - Core syscare operations (health, cleanup, backup) still complete successfully.
   - Pending reports are **retried automatically** on the next successful run.

This design ensures system maintainance **never depends on backend availability**, making syscare safe for production systems.
---

## Development Mode

* Run directly from repo without installing:

```bash
./syscare.sh all
```

* JSON reports, logs, and backups will be stored in the repo tree (`logs/`, `backups/`).

---

## Future Enhancements

* **Backend enhancements**: alerts, authentication, dashboards
* **Alerts & notifications**: e.g., email if thresholds are exceeded
* Packaging as `.deb` or `.rpm` for easier installation
* Hardening and security improvements

---
## Uninstall

### Remove Syscare Agent

```bash
chmod 755 uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
or (minimally)
```bash
chmod +rx uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
This removes syscare binaries, configs, logs, backups, and systemd units.

### Remove Syscare Backend

```bash
chmod 755 uninstall-backend.sh
./uninstall-backend.sh
```
or (minimally)
```bash
chmod +rx uninstall-backend.sh
./uninstall-backend.sh
```
--
### Verify
```bash
ls -l uninstall.sh uninstall-backend.sh
```
Your should see:
